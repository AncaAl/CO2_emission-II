CO2 Emissions Prediction
This project aims to predict CO2 emissions from vehicles based on various characteristics using different machine learning models. Our goal is to identify the most effective model that provides high accuracy and precision in its predictions. Through extensive testing and comparison of models such as Decision Trees, KNN, and AdaBoost, we strive to deliver reliable insights and explore future improvements by integrating advanced techniques and considering the impact of emerging technologies.
